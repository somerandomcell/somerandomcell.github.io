## Hello World

Yo, what's good, fam? I'm Thomas Labuschagne, a 19-year-old cybersecurity enthusiast. Welcome to my blog! Today, I'm stoked to introduce myself and share my journey in the world of cybersecurity.

### My Journey

So, I started my cybersecurity journey when I was just 15. I was always curious about how things work, especially when it comes to tech. I was like, "Yo, how do these hackers do their thing?" and that curiosity led me down this awesome path.

### Current Studies

Right now, I'm grinding hard on some certifications, specifically with **TCM Security**. It's been dope learning advanced penetration testing and ethical hacking. To keep it real, I'm also smashing it on practical platforms like **Hack The Box** and **TryHackMe**. These platforms are like the gym for my cybersecurity skills, and I'm lifting heavy every day.

### Skills and Interests

Here's what I'm packing in my cybersecurity toolkit:

- **Python Programming**: I'm fluent in scripting and automation.
- **Linux Fundamentals**: I got a strong grip on Linux OS and command-line tools.
- **Web Security Techniques**:
  - **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)** vulnerabilities
  - **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** vulnerabilities
- **Interests in Learning**:
  - **NIM**: Exploring NIM for advanced scripting and automation.
  - **JavaScript**: Enhancing web security skills through JavaScript.

### Community Involvement

I'm not just about learning, I'm also about giving back. I started a cybersecurity learning community called **SecureSphere Academy**. It's a place where we all share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and level up together.

#### Join the Discord Server

I also run a dope **Discord server** where we chill, discuss, and hack together. If you're down to join the fam, [click here to join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/3aMhWUJuzq). Trust me, it's lit!

### Goals

My goal is to blend academic knowledge with real-world experience. I'm aiming to boost my job prospects and contribute positively to the cybersecurity industry. I see myself protecting digital assets, preventing cyber threats, and mentoring the next generation of cybersecurity pros.

### Call to Action

If you're as passionate about cybersecurity as I am, hit me up and let's connect. Whether you're a newbie, a pro, or just curious, there's always room for growth and collaboration. Let's make the digital world a safer place together.
