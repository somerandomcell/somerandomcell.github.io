### Introduction to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

### Key Concepts

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
- **Integrity**: Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods.
- **Availability**: Ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when required.

### Learning Resources

Here are some resources to help you get started:

- **Books**:
  - "Cybersecurity for Dummies" by Joseph Steinberg
  - "The Web Application Hacker's Handbook" by Dafydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto

- **Online Courses**:
  - [Coursera - Introduction to Cyber Security Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/intro-cyber-security)
  - [edX - Cybersecurity Fundamentals](https://www.edx.org/course/cybersecurity-fundamentals)

- **Websites**:
  - [Khan Academy - Cybersecurity](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography)
  - [Cybrary - Free Cybersecurity Training](https://www.cybrary.it/)

### Tools and Technologies

- **Wireshark**: A network protocol analyzer that lets you capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network.
- **Metasploit**: A penetration testing framework that makes hacking simple.
- **Nmap**: A free and open-source network scanner designed to discover hosts and services on a computer network.

### My Progress

So far, I've completed the following:

- **Completed Courses**:
  - Introduction to Cyber Security Specialization on Coursera
  - Cybersecurity Fundamentals on edX

- **Practical Experience**:
  - Set up a virtual lab environment using VirtualBox and Kali Linux.
  - Performed basic network scanning and vulnerability assessment using Nmap and Metasploit.

### Conclusion

Cybersecurity is a vast and ever-evolving field. By staying curious and continuously learning, you can build a strong foundation and contribute to protecting digital assets. I hope this guide helps you get started on your cybersecurity journey.
